<b>Sound Bath</b><br>
An unforgettable sound experience for those who seek deep relaxation, rejuvenation and
an acceleration of their inward journey. Time is suspended as you enter a world of vibration,
sensation and experience. Physical injuries can be healed and old emotional traumas released.
Great insights can be accessed. You feel truly, vibrantly alive. Once you’ve had your
first Sound Bath you’ll want more.
</p><p>
<b>Love Who You Are</b><br>
This guided meditation leads to an affirmation to help you learn to be gentle and loving
toward yourself. Take a moment to tell yourself what you need to hear and remind yourself
that whatever it is that you’re trying to do is truly possible. By doing this you will develop one
of the most essential necessities of life: learning to love yourself.
</p><p>
<b>Acceptance & Forgiveness</b><br>
A powerful meditation to help you practice forgiveness towards those who might have hurt
you in the past, those you might have hurt at one point in your life, as well as forgiveness
towards yourself for all the things you might have done to hurt or harm yourself. It’s powerful
and very efficient. You will definitely love it.
</p><p>
<b>Universal Love</b><br>
In a world of global upheaval, this meditation guides you to be open to the energy of
goodwill. The purpose is to stimulate and increase the use of love and positivity in a troubled
world, and act as a channel through which the energy of goodwill can flow more abundantly
from spiritual levels into the hearts and minds of all people.
